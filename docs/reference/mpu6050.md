# Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU)

The `mpu6050` has an i2c interface, reading raw sensor values from both
gyroscope and accelerometer data is the easy part, the harder part involves
combining both sensor data in-order to obtain a more reliable device
orientation. In the following we will detail how we first calculate the device
orientation angles from both the gyroscope and accelerometer, then once we have
the angles we combine them using the complimentary filter.


## Calculate the Device Angle from Gyroscope Data
The raw sensor values from the gyroscope are in degrees per second, this is the
rate of change of the angular position over time (angular velocity). If we
integrate this angular velocity we can obtain the angular position (or the
angle we want).

In code we can calculate the angle from gyroscope data like so:

    #include <time.h>
    #include <math.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        double angle;
        double dt;
        clock_t start;
        clock_t end;

        /* setup */
        angle = 0;
        start = clock();

        while (1) {
            /* calculate dt */
            end = clock();
            dt = ((double) (end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

            /* get angle from gyroscope */
            angle = gyro_get_x();  /* your custom get function */

            /* calculate angle by integration */
            angle += angle * dt;

            /* update start time */
            start = clock();
        }

        return 0;
    }

This however is subject to rounding errors, this is why more accurate
approximations such as Runge Kutta (RK4) was devised. For our purposes we used
the complimentary filter to mitigate errors (which will be explained below).


## Calculate the Device Angle from Accelerometer Data

    angle x = arctan(x / sqrt(pow(y, 2), pow(z, 2)))
    angle y = arctan(y / sqrt(pow(x, 2), pow(z, 2)))

In code we can calculate the angle from gyroscope data like so:


    #include <math.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        double x;
        double y;
        double z;

        double angle_x;
        double angle_y;
        double angle_z;

        /* setup */
        angle_x = 0;
        angle_y = 0;
        angle_z = 0;

        while (1) {
            /* get angle from accelerometer sensor */
            x = accel_get_x();  /* your custom get function */
            y = accel_get_y();  /* your custom get function */
            z = accel_get_z();  /* your custom get function */

            angle_x = arctan(x / sqrt(pow(y, 2), pow(z, 2)))
            angle_y = arctan(y / sqrt(pow(x, 2), pow(z, 2)))
        }

        return 0;
    }
