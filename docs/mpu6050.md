    int mpu6050_gyroscope_test(void);

This function performs a gyroscope self-test on the MPU6050 sensor, this is
initiated by setting the `XG_ST`, `YG_ST` and `ZG_ST` to 1 respectively in the
`GYRO_CONFIG` register.

In the [Register Map document (page 14)][1] it says:

> When the value of the self-test response is within the min/max limits >
of the product specification, the part has passed self test.

According to the datasheet (page 12), it states that the min/max is a
relative +/- 14% of the sensor data, before and after the self-test is
enabled.

    mpu6050_accelerometer_test(void);

This function performs a accelerometer self-test on the MPU6050 sensor,
this is initiated by setting the `XA_ST`, `YA_ST` and `ZA_ST` to 1
respectively in the `ACCEL_CONFIG` register.

In the [Register Map document (page 15)][1] it says:

> When the value of the self-test response is within the min/max limits >
of the product specification, the part has passed self test.

According to the datasheet (page 13), it states that the min/max is a
relative +/- 14% of the sensor data, before and after the self-test is
enabled.
